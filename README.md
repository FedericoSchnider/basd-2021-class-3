# How work was done, commited, and pushed.

- I started with HTML layout using HTML including semantic tags and divs for CSS Flex-Box.
- Used Flex-Box and CSS from top to bottom aligning and giving aesthetics at the same time to each part.
- When design for a certain device display was done I proceeded to a bigger display.
- I constantly checked view from different display settings and checked container selectors using inspect on index.html.
- When displays for laptop, tablet and mobile looked finished I checked the code using W3 Validator and JSFiddle.
- Checked display for every device again and fixed mistakes noticed by Validator and Fiddle.
